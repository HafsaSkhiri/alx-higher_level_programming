Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. In TDD, the development cycle typically follows these steps:

Write a Test: Initially, a test case is created that describes the desired behavior or functionality of the code. The test is written in a testing framework like unittest or pytest in Python.
Run the Test: The newly created test is executed, and since there is no implementation code yet, the test is expected to fail. This confirms that the test is indeed testing the desired functionality.
Write the Code: The minimal code required to pass the test is implemented. The aim is to write only the code necessary to make the test pass and not to focus on the complete implementation.
Run All Tests: After writing the code, all the existing tests are executed, including the new one. If any test fails, it indicates that either the new code or the existing code has introduced a regression, and further development is required.
Refactor: Once all the tests pass, the code can be refactored to improve its design, efficiency, or maintainability. The tests act as a safety net, ensuring that any changes made during the refactoring process do not introduce bugs or break the desired functionality.
Repeat: The process continues iteratively, with new tests being written to describe additional functionality or edge cases, followed by implementing the code to make those tests pass. The cycle of writing tests, running tests, coding, and refactoring is repeated until all the desired functionality is implemented.
Test-driven development promotes a more systematic and disciplined approach to software development. It helps ensure that the code meets the expected requirements, reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs or regressions, and encourages a modular and testable code design. By writing tests first, developers gain a clear understanding of the desired behavior, which can guide the implementation process and improve the overall quality of the code.
